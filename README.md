Some of my config files
*************************

Some of my config files shared for the general public.
Some are censored to not contain information that I'd like to keep secret,
most things that contain a lot of account data / host names / very telling path names
are just plainly left out.

For that reason you'll find references to scripts or other files that do not exist
in this repository. I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but you'll likely not be able
to just blindly copy things from here and run them.

If however you're just looking for inspiration for your own setup,
you are very welcome to do so :-)
